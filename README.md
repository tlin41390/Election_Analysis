## Overview of Election Analysis
### Purpose
    The purpose of the project is to help develop a better understanding of programing with different
    data sets and files and then interpret that data to make it more accessible and provide a summary 
    of big data sets and what they mean, and for this example it would be election results and the 
    percentages

### Election Audit Summary
    The election data can be used to determine the turnout of other counties and determine if there
    may be correlation with the high amount of data in one county over the other. In addition you can
    use the data to see which people in which county are more likely to vote for which candidate and 
    their political views, which can help in deciding which county is more left leaning or right leaning.
    The script can be modified if we use functions to make the code more accessible to larger scale elections
    like the presidential election. In addition we can add the political affiliation of the candidates in order to
    figure out which county or which area is goint to be more likely to vote for which type of candidate.
